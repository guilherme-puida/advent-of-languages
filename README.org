#+title: Advent of Languages

These are my solutions to [[https://adventofcode.com][Advent of Code]] 2022 problems.

As a challenge, every day is solved using a different programming language!

| Day | Language   |
|-----+------------|
|  01 | JavaScript |
|  02 | Python     |
|  03 | Ruby       |
|  04 | Lua        |
|  05 | Crystal    |

You can also see the solutions and output at [[https://advent.puida.xyz]].

Every solution has a =run.sh= file that can be executed to build and run the solution.
To run all solutions, use the =run.sh= in the root of the repository.

There is also a script to download input files for a given year and day.
To use it, create a =.cookie= file in the root of the repository with site cookie.

#+begin_src shell
AOC_COOKIE="input_your_cookie_here"
#+end_src

Then run the script to download the specified input.

#+begin_src shell
./download.sh 2015 5
#+end_src
